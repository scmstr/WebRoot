                        subdivided video sections walking you through tons of major subjects, and

                        It seems obvious once you think about it, but Wikipedia can often 
                        provide much more information on software development topics than 
                        you’d think. Providing history, criticisms, business information, and 
                        other relevant information can help you make informed decisions on 
                        the business level, but also give you insights as to the abstract 
                        ideas and direction that the creators of a language or system hold.

                        Google Images also will come as a surprise to a lot of people, but 
                        having a keyword searched grid of images by one of the most sophisticated 
                        search algorithms in the world can be pretty helpful, and upon quickly 
                        scanning across a quick search result, can be the difference between 
                        hours of videos or reading, or simply a few seconds that it takes for 
                        a good or new visual to understand how an idea works. Never underestimate 
                        either the power of actually seeing it to understand, nor the power of 
                        human convolution in words to waste time.

                        Sometimes, we have to suck it up and actually refer to the official 
                        documentation of a language. Most languages and systems are either 
                        old enough and well enough used to have great official documentation 
                        or be new enough to understand the importance of concise, accurate 
                        documentation. The information is there, you just have to reach out
